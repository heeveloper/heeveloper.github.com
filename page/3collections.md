## Algorithms
This page mainly handles algorithm problems presented in the book **"프로그래밍 대회에서 배우는 알고리즘 문제해결전략"** and other websites such as **백준온라인(BOJ)** or **SCPC**. If you implement your code, it can be tested by [Algospot](https://algospot.com), [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/) and [SCPC](https://www.codeground.org/main.do).
<br> Here are problems I dealt with.

* QUADTREE
* FENCE
* PI
* WILDCARD
* PACKING
* NUMBERGAME
* LUNCHBOX
